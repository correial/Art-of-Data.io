# Which dataset did you work with?

- I worked with a dataset titled "NBA - Player Salary (1990-2017)". It can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/whitefero/nba-player-salary-19902017)
- In this dataset there are seven differnt categorical variables: Register Value, Player Name, Salary in $, Season Start, Season End, Abbreviated Team Name, and Full Team Name
- In order to test the credibility of the dataset, I researched different salaries for players from 1990-2017 to ensure that they matched up the the data from the CSV, which they did. I also checked the results from my graph to ensure that the averages calculated were accurate. I did this by comparing the average player salary each year that my graph printed to the average player salary each year from the internet, and they matched up! Given this, I do not believe that there is any information missing from this dataset. Additionally, all of the statistics from the dataset are quantative, and thus are not affected by biases.
- From this dataset, I am hoping to learn about and explore trends of NBA player salaries over the 27 year period!

- **Marks and Channels:** The marks on this graphs are the bars. I decided to use a bar chart as it effectively illustrates a trend between a categorical variable and a numerical varaible without much analyzation. The channels on this graph are the color of the vertical bars, the height of the vertical bars, the orientation of the axis, the widths of the vertical bars, and the order of the vertical bars. 
1. First off, I chose to make all of the bars one color as there is really no reason to group them by color. Changing their color based off of year is unnecessary in my mind. Additionally, I chose to make all of the bars blue as they stand out well against the white backdrop and black font
2. The second artistic decision I made was the orentation of the axis. The "Season Start" is the independent varaible and thus traditionally belongs on the x-axis. Additionally, if I placed 27 different categorical varaibles on the y-axis the graph would be exessivly tall and hard to see the entire graph at once, rendering the viewers ability to compare the bars. I also gave each axis a clear title to correspond with each set of variables
3. The third artistic choice was the width of each bar. Similar to the oreintation of the axis, I wanted to be able to see each bar on the graph at once while also making it clear to the viewer which bar corresponds to each year. Given this, I chose a balance of the two.
4. The final artistic choice was the orentation of the vertical bars. Given that the goal of the visualization was to illustrate the change in NBA Player Salaries over time, it made the most sense to order the x-axis by oldest to most recent dates. 
- **Major Takeaways**: From the graph above, there is clearly a  directly proportional relationship between "Season Start" and "Salary in $"; generally, as time increases, so does the average NBA Player Salary. While during some years the average player salary does decrease, there is no one factor that contributes to it. I verified this by researching why salaries decreased in 2014. There was no particular reason or event that caused this. In short, we can see that the average salary in the NBA increase trenemdously from 1990-2017, increasing by approximetly $5,600,000!
