# Brief Summary of the Article
* Artificial intelligence and different computer science programs have made their way into the world of sports. Goal Line Technology is only one of many algorithems to be implemented in soccer to increase accuracy and fairness of the game. The referees wear watches that communicate with the system. If a goal is scored, the watch with notify the referee in case assistance is needed in a close call. 
* This goal line technology relies on the use of an electromagnetic field. An electrical current flows through the post and crossbar of the goal, creating a magnetic field. The soccer ball supposidly contains three coils that interact and alter the magnetic field. These changes in magnetic field are analyzed and can be studied to precisely locate the location of the ball.
* In this study, the model is in its prototype state and is only undergoing basic experiments. FIFA requires the technology to pass several stages of testing before it can be implemented in professional leagues. 


# Analyze and question the data that the scientists use
* For the most part, the data that the scientists used during their research proved their prototype to be effective and fairly reliable. The goal of this article and technology was not necessarily to insure that the goal line technology would be used in actual matches as it is still in early stages of testing. However, with further improvement, it has the ability to find its way into professional soccer leagues 
* Given that the goal line technology is still in early stages of testing, there are not many variables tested within the experiment. The only test conducted was sliding a ball over a goal line to check for accuracy. However, in a real life application, the ball could be spinning, hit posts, enter at different angles and deflect of players. In addition, weather conditions play a large role in the accuracy of goal line technology. Studies in different weather conditions are thus required.

# Analyze their results. Do you trust their findings? Why or why not?  
* The results from the very basic tests were farily accurate and consistent. 
* For the first part of the experiment, the ball was moved back and forth across the goal line, at a distance of .8 meters from one of the goal posts. The margin of error was very small; on average returning that the ball passed the goal line after it traveled 3.0 mm past the line rather than signaling a goal immediatly after the ball passed the line (0.1mm). This margin of error can be explained by the fact that the test was conducted manually; therefore there was human reaction time delay in signalling the goal.
* In the other part of the experiment the ball was placed 3.6 meters from one of the goal posts, and its margin of error was also fairly insignificant. On average, the program called a goal when the ball was .6mm in front of the line rather than .1mm behind it.
* While we are only dealing with mm in this experiment, there is still some amount of variation in results. Given that this test was very basic, I do not believe that the results should vary as much as they did. Especially since in a real match, calling a goal invalid when it is 3mm past the goal line could be the deciding factor in a match.

# How might "publish or perish" have affected this study?
* I do not believe that there was any P-hacking that took place, nor was there an incentive to lie about the data collected throughout the experieriment. The technology will need to be tested by numerous different people and programs before it can be distributed to professional leagues for use. Thus, there would be no use in altering results as this product will not be "published", but imporved on until it passes all stages for use.
* Additionally, there would be no incentive to limit the sources of research, or keep parts of the experiement hard to access as companies will have to replicate the expieriments themselves to insure that the product works.
