# Identify a statistical question that you could ask.
Does the use of the Molle 2 Backpack (name of the prototype from the article) reduce upper body muscle stress or overuse in College Students?

<br>

# Identify the population you would study to answer the question. What information about the population would help answer your question?
* Population I would study: College Students 
* Helpful information about the population:
    * The weight of their normal school backpack with its belongings
    * Age
    * Any prior medical conditions or current medical conditions that could affect the results
    * Body type (weight, height, etc...)
    * Amount of daily activity that would contribute the measurements of muscle stress and muscle activations

<br>

# Identify a feasible sample frame, and explain your reasoning.
* College Students in New York
    * This sample size would effectively represent the population for the experiment as college students in New York should have similar attributes, characteristics, and typical backpack weight as most other students
    * Additionally, we would only use students without a prior medical conditions to rule out exceptions to results 
    * College Students in New York is a feasible sample size as if would be difficult to recruit students from other states in the experiment as they may be busy and thus reluctant to drive far to collect data

<br>

# Identify the sampling method you would use, and explain your reasoning. What makes this method better than the others?
* I would use the **simple random** technique to randomly select college students in New York to compile my sample size
* This means that I would need to assign each subject in the sampling frame a random number, then randomly generate numbers to include these subjects
* This is the best method of selecting test subjects as it reduces bias as the students are randomly selected, and additionally increases the probability of using diverse students from a variety of colleges in New York

<br>

# Suppose you had the means to run an experiment on this sample. Identify the null and alternative hypotheses.
* **Null Hypothesis:** the Molle 2 Backpack has no effect on upper body muscle stress and overuse for college students (there is no relationship)
* **Alternative Hypothesis:** the Molle 2 Backpack does reduce upper body muscle stress and helps to eliminate muscle overuse in college students

<br>

# Identify the variables and treatments that would provide information about your question. Explain your choice of treatments.
* Variables that we will look for while testing muscle activation and stress over time are:
    * Stress and strength of shoulder muscle compared to baseline (control group)
    * Fatigue on shoulder muscle 
    * Overall subjective feeling of comfort retaining to the backpack
    * Muscle activations of leg muscles to see if the upper body load is successfully being transferred to the lower body for students
* Treatments: 
    * All subjects in the **experimental group** will receive the same treatment
    * They will all wear the Molle 2 Backpack the whole time while at school 
    * They will run tests and be compliant in recording data when they are in our lab

<br>

# Identify the treatment groups, and how each subject would be assigned to a group.
* **Control Group:** this group will use any backpack of their choice throughout the school day (other than the Molle 2 Backpack) 
* **Experimental Group:** the experimental group will wear the Molle 2 backpack while at school 
* Inorder to assign people to one of these two groups, we will use simple random to work towards eliminating human bias

<br>

# Briefly discuss how the experiment would be conducted.
* Me and my highly qualified team will conduct trials over the course of the year
* The students should wear the appropriate backpack throughout the school day and will come into our lab to run additional tests and to collect data regarding upper body muscle fatigue
* We will measure all four variables with each of the college students that come into the lab, looking for trends to ensure that no data we get is a false positive
* Graphs of the muscle activations will be constructed as shown in the article

<br>

# What biases may come up, and how would you address them?
* Given the sole use of simple random for selecting students for our sample and treatment groups, we should not encounter much bias throughout our experiment 
* However, when biases do come up, our team will look to find its possible effect on our data, and alter the test subjects to help represent the most diverse test subjects within our population
