# Lucca's Prior Experiance With Computer Science

![First](https://www.team340.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2854749_orig.jpg)

I personally have a gravitation to STEM with Engieering and Computer Science. Since Middle School at Horace Mann I joined all the robotics clubs that were acessable to me. **Since 6th grade I took part in the following Engineering and Computer Science clubs, teams, and courses:** 
1. FLL (6th - 8th grade)
2. Intro to Engineering and Robotics (9th grade)
3. FTC Robotics Team (9th & 10th grade)
4. Computer Science 1 (summer of 9th grade)
5. Computer Science 2 (10th grade)
6. Art of Data (11th grade)
7. FRC Robotics (11th grade)


# Something Lucca likes -- this can be a hobby, sport, TV show, game, book, food, artist, etc. 

**I love skiing!** Its so simple... I love skiing! If you don't believe me, here is a quote with me talking about skiing:

> There is no feeling better in the world, not one more exhilirating that flying down a race course with the sounds of carving down the mountain...

There it is, his words, not mine. He claims that he loved all aspects of sking, terrain park runs, race ski courses, and venturing to different mountains with family and friends. My biggest accomplishment up to date is **winning the U16 Pennsylvania State Championship this past winter**

# Something Lucca is looking forward to this year. 

I look forward to publishing the best website of all time... **_NO ONE will stop me!!_** I will work hours to perfecting my markdown language knowledge and one day I will be better at making websites than Mr. Lee, hopefully. Either way, being confident with what I learn in Art of Data is something I look forward to.
